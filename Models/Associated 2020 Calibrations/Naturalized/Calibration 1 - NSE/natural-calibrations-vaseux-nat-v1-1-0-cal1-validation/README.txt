#Metdata for Okanagan Raven Hydrology Model

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#ABSTRACT:
This model was developed by Associated Environmental Consultants Inc. (Associated) in 2020 to support Okanagan Hydrologic Modelling Environment (Associated, 2020).
The model is calibrated to naturalized flow time series generated by Associated (2019), with a focus on capturing peak flows.
The validated model, posted here, is a result of the best model solution obtained from multiple calibration trials. 
For more details, please see the final report linked under RESOURCES.

An updated version of this model that runs with Raven v3.7 is available on GitHub (see link under RESOURCES).

#ORGANIZATION:

#MODEL EXECUTABLE:
This model is developed to run on Raven v3.0.
The user is cautioned to conduct their own checks prior to using this model with other versions of the Raven executables.

#SPATIAL COVERAGE:
This model includes 8 subbasins that cover the Vaseux Creek watershed with 1,509 HRUs.
There are no reservoirs represented in this model.

#TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
The model can run on historical climate data from 1993-2017 (see climate data).

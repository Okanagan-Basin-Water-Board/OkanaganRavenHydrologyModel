#Metdata for Okanagan Raven Hydrology Model

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#ABSTRACT:
This model is an update of the original Raven watershed model developed by Associated Environmental Consultants Inc. (Associated) in 2020 to support Okanagan Hydrologic Modelling Environment (Associated, 2020).
The original model was calibrated to naturalized flow time series generated by Associated (2019).
The calibration involved multiple calibration trials: of the results from these trials, the best model solution was subsequently used in model validation.
The model used in model validation was updated to run with Raven v3.7. 
The model now operates a new reservoir representation scheme contained within Raven v3.7 and includes bug fixes to maintain open water evaporation when simulating the mass balance on lakes and reservoirs.

#ORGANIZATION:

#MODEL EXECUTABLE:
The model was originally developed to run on Raven v3.0 but has since been updated to run with Raven v3.7. The model outputs generated with v3.7 closely resemble that of v3.0 but do not exactly match. 
The user is cautioned to conduct their own checks prior to using this model with other versions of the Raven executables. 

#SPATIAL COVERAGE:
This model includes 15 subbasins that cover the Whiteman Creek watershed with 1,429 HRUs.
There is 1 reservoir represented in this model.

#TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
The model can run on historical climate data from 1993-2017 (see climate data) as well as future projections to 2100 (data pre-processing required).
